This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Foreword

Hi, thanks for sending the test. I tried my best to get all specs in this application. Because I usually work in bigger projects where the foundations are already laid out, setting up a React architecture from scratch was a challenge I wanted to take on. I didn't use Redux because it felt like overkill, so I tried my hand on the `Unstated` library.<br/>
I believe I excel more in css, responsive design, setting up component libraries, semantics & browser testing in a React tech stack, but the focus here was to get the whole app working.
